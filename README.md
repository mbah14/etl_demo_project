# ETL_demo_project: An ETL Pipeline using Spotify API

This project is based on the amazing work by [Karolina Sowinska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolina-sowinska-b3070b103/) from her [youtube course on Data Engineering For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvviIUKwH7o). The original source code can be found at [**GitHub**](https://github.com/karolina-sowinska/free-data-engineering-course-for-beginners).

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build an ETL pipeline using the Spotify API. Specifically, we will be using the [**Get Recently Played Tracks**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) endpoint to extract the user's recently played tracks, transform the data, and load it into a database for analysis.

By following this project, I have learned the following:

- Connect to a RESTful API using Python
- Extract and transform data using Python libraries such as Pandas
- Load data into a database using SQLAlchemy
- Create a basic ETL pipeline using Python and SQL

In addition to the technical aspects, this project also includes a fun twist! Many of my friends have claimed that I listen to too much Afrobeats artist such as Burna Boy. To prove them wrong (or right?), I have set up a Twilio alert system where I receive a text message whenever I listen to Burna Boy in the past five days.
